# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

You need to call the cleanup function of side effect when you reset the game.How to reset the game by unmounting the component rather than resetting the state.Because when you unmount the component React will call all the cleanups that you have.

When we click on the play again button React is going to change the GameId value from 1 to 2 & that will make the game unmount, clear all the side effects and mount a new game with a new state.

Game Component is managing the state -> initializing the state, defining side effects, cleaning up side effects & also transacting on the state using set calls here. This logic belongs to the same place. React has a way for us to extract all this logic into its own function. This new function is called a Custom Hook.

Custom Hook is a special function because its going to be stateful function. extract the logic of basic hooks: useState & useEffect & we are going to group these hooks in a single custom function. Its special becuase its using React hooks function. SO we create custom hooks with the name starting from use. Always use React hooks function in the same order. U cant have an if statement around one of the hooks.

AFter creating custom hooks componets responsibility is mostly to describe the UI.

When we ship things to browser we need to ship everything as a single bundle because browsers dont know how to work with modules yet. Practice to ship Javascript app is to bundle all your application in a single file & ship that to browser. Webpack package is going to do the bundling for us.
